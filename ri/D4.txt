Winehouse is the latest deceased star to get the hologram treatment. Back in 2012 Tupac performed alongside Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg at Coachella (the company, Digital Domain, has since gone out of business). That hologram wasn't really a hologram, either, more-so an update on a very old stage trick using mirrors.

Comedians Andy Kaufman and Redd Foxx have been rumored since 2015 to go on tour, although it hasn't yet come to pass. Even popular gorilla Harambe is set / was set to become a hologram at one point in time. That, too, hasn't happened yet.It's worth mentioning that towards the end of her life, Amy was consumed by alcohol addiction and her live shows became chaotic. It became a popular topic for jokes both stateside and back in her native U.K., which increased her usage, which ultimately led to her death of alcohol poisoning at just 27.

Why mention this? Well, the way that Amy died is quite a delicate subject, especially amongst her fans, i.e. how do you present or protect her legacy?

Indeed, Amy Winehouse was one of the most prismatic performers of the 00's and from a sheer production standpoint alone the idea of capturing her persona seems limiting from the outset. Do you show 2008 Amy in her "prime" performing all the hits or do you show her having a ton of fun doing a slightly-silly cover of Toots & The Mayals "Monkey Man"? This is, after all, the same woman who had a blast being extremely honest and in the moment (slightly NSFW). How do you capture that?

So while it remains to be seen exactly what the show will be like, her fans aren't exactly happy about the news.
