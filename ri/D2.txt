Kevin Hines, one of the few people to ever survive jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge, waited at the railing for 40 minutes. He later recounted, “If someone had smiled and said, ‘Are you okay?’ I would not have jumped. I just was unable to ask for help myself.”
I want to check in on my friends. But when I open my mouth to smile, it turns into a laugh.
Of course we want to kill ourselves. It’s 2018.
When one friend needs help, you give them help. But what about 20? What about the constant, low-level mental suffering that each of my friends seems to be going through?
I’m afraid it’s like the noise from an air-conditioner; I’m not going to notice it until it stops.
I’ll misinterpret the tone of a text; I’ll laugh when I should be smiling; I’ll smile when I should be crying.
I’ll reply one minute too late.
One of my friends will kill themselves while I eat Greek yogurt and bananas.
Because all my friends want to kill themselves.
